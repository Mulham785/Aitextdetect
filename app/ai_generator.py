The Internet, a global network of networks, has transformed how we access information and communicate with others. Network protocols such as TCP/IP provide the foundation for data transmission across networks. The design of efficient and secure networks involves addressing challenges related to scalability, reliability, and performance. Emerging technologies like 5G and software-defined networking are shaping the future of network infrastructure.",
            "Networking technologies continue to evolve to meet the growing demands for connectivity and bandwidth. Local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), and wireless networks each serve different communication needs. Network security is a critical concern, with threats ranging from unauthorized access to malicious attacks. The development of network protocols and architectures must balance performance, security, and ease of management.
